## Overview
  Welcome to the repository of ATM Rush Clone, an engaging mobile game developed using Unity. This project aims not just to replicate the fun and dynamic experience of the original ATM Rush but also to enhance it with robust architectural principles, cutting-edge technologies, and refined gameplay mechanics. Our clone stands out with its meticulous attention to detail, adherence to SOLID principles, and utilization of design patterns like Singleton, Command, Observer, Strategy, and State for scalable and maintainable code architecture.

## Key Features
- `Dynamic Camera Transitions:` Leveraging the power of Cinemachine, we've crafted smooth and responsive camera movements, enriching the player's experience as they switch between main gameplay and mini-games.
- `Stunning Visuals:` By integrating advanced "Post Process" settings, the game's visuals are not just vibrant but also create an immersive atmosphere that keeps players engaged.
- `Modular Design:` The game is built with modularity in mind. Every component and system is designed to function independently yet cohesively, ensuring easy updates and feature scalability.
- `Automated Systems:` Emphasizing automation, the game's mechanics and workflows are streamlined, ensuring a focus on gameplay and user experience.

# Technical Highlights
## Design Patterns:
- `Singleton:` Ensures critical game components such as managers are easily accessible throughout the game without duplicating objects.
- `Command:` Enables a flexible mechanism to perform actions, undo operations, and decouple requesters of operations from the objects executing them.
- `Observer:` Implements a subscription model to broadcast and react to game events, reducing dependencies and enhancing modularity.
- `Strategy:` Facilitates the use of different algorithms or strategies in runtime, allowing dynamic changes in the game's behavior.
- `State:` Manages complex state transitions in the game with Cinemachine.
- `Cinemachine Integration:` This adds cinematic quality and precision to camera movements, enhancing the overall player experience and immersion.
